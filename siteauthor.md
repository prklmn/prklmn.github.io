title: About Me

Hi! I'm Jordan Perlman, a medical student and the author of this site. I'm pursuing a career in PM&R and thought I'd make this website to serve as a introduction to Physiatry for my friends and family as most were unfamiliar with the specialty.

This website was created on a medical student's budget of $1 using [GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-or-removing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site). You can [shoot me an email](mailto:jp@aboutphysiatry.com) if you have any feedback or questions regarding the site.
