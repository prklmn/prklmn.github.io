### What's the difference between Physiatrists and Physical Therapists?

Both treat similar patient populations, however, their roles are quite different. Physiatrists can prescribe physical therapy, and are responsible for medical oversight through the rehabilitation process, including medication management and ensuring the patient is medically stable enough to participate in rehabilitation related activities. On the other hand, Physical therapists help to create physical therapy treatment plans and can directly provide this therapy for patients. Physiatrists and Physical Therapists work closely together to help patients regain functional status.  


### What's the difference between Physiatrists and Orthopedic Surgeons?

Both are physicians and treat patient populations with significant overlap, however their roles are distinct. Orthopedic Surgeons perform invasive surgeries and Physiatrist do not. It is common for patients to be referred to a Physiatrist by an Orthopedic Surgeon before and or after surgery, or if they are not a good surgical candidate. Orthopedic Surgeons typically do not see their patients in the inpatient rehabilitation setting.
